The Sample App
--------------

This tutorial demonstrates how to create backend services using ASP.NET Core MVC to support native mobile apps. It uses the `Xamarin Forms TodoRest app <https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/web-services/consuming/rest/>` as its native client, which includes separate native clients for Android, iOS, Windows Universal, and Window Phone devices. The sample application includes an ASP.NET Web API 2 services project, which this article's ASP.NET Core MVC app will replace (with no changes required by the client).

.. note:: This document does not cover securing web APIs. This topic will be covered in a follow-up article.
